### In Builing this project, *Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS* were used and adhered to the MVC file structure.  Additionally, several models had all 7 RESTful routes used and full CRUD.

### The logo animation and other animations were the most fun to create. In the app, after a user account is created, custom guitar specs can be added, edited, updated, deleted.  In the future, I would like for the newly created guitar pictures to be more visually specific to each instrument's build.
